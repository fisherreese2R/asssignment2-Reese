Some interesting facts about me would be I played basketball, baseball, track, academic bowl, and <br>
participated in clubs such as FFA, FBLA, NHS. Outside of high school some of my hobbies are working <br>
on cars, hunting, fishing, and driving a racecar on the weekends.

### Countries To Visit
I have been to quite a few different countries over the years, some I had alot of fun in whereas others were <br>
scary at times and dangerous. When traveling it is a great idea to checkout the neighborhood/area you are going<br> to and not just the resort you are staying at. The resort could look very nice and pretty but when you adventure<br>
outside your resort it could be very dangerous and unwelcoming.
