# Fisher Reese 
I am from Memphis, MO and went to Adair County RII high school in Brashear, MO. <br>
Some interesting facts about me would be I played basketball, baseball, track, academic bowl, and <br>
participated in clubs such as FFA, FBLA, NHS. Outside of high school some of my hobbies are working <br>
on cars, hunting, fishing, and driving a racecar on the weekends.
