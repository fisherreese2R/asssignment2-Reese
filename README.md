### Golden State Warriors
<p>I like the Golden State Warriors because they have Stephen Curry who is the <br>
**greatest shooter of all time**. He is very fun to watch since he takes ***crazy shots*** that <br> 
should never go in the bucket but when the lights are the brightest and the stage is set it <br>
seems he always delivers. </p>
