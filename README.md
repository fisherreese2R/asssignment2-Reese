### Golden State Warriors
I like the Golden State Warriors because they have Stephen Curry who is the <br>
___greatest shooter of all time__. He is very fun to watch since he takes ***crazy shots*** that <br> 
should never go in the bucket but when the lights are the brightest and the stage is set it <br>
seems he always delivers.
